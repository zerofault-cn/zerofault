By using the Free Web Design Icon Set you agree to the following:

All ownership and copyright of the icons remains the property of SEM Labs (semlabs.co.uk).

The icons may be modified.

The icons may be used in both non-commercial and commercial works.

The icons may not be sold standalone in their current or modified form.

All stock icons are provided "As is." You agree not to hold SEM Labs liable for any damage that may occur as a result of using these icons.

Finally attribution is very much appreciated, but not necessary. If used on a website, attribution is not necessary on every page; a link on an about page or credits page is fine. If you are unsure about attribution, drop an email on the contact form (semlabs.co.uk/contact). Giving attribution helps us folks who are producing free work and may lead to the expansion of this icon pack. Also, I'd like to see any site or other works that are using these icons.
